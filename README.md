### Computational Analysis of Semantic Framing in Colombian Political Discourse

> **Note on Project Evolution**: This repository documents my learning journey in computational linguistics. The `z_archive/` folder contains my initial exploratory work (Phase 1: Exploratory work). Based on that learning, I refocused the project on a more specific research question about contested political terms.

### Project Evolution

### Phase 1: Exploratory Work (Archived)

**Goal**: Broad ambiguity analysis across Colombian legal decrees  
**Learned**: 
- Data collection (PDF extraction, OCR)
- spaCy basics for Spanish NLP
- Scope needed refinement for pre-MA work

### Phase 2: # Exploratory Analysis of Colombian Post-Peace Accord Discourse

**Description:** This pilot analysis explores semantic framing in Colombian post-accord media discourse as groundwork for my proposed MA research on pragmatic inference and epistemic models.

**Methodology:** 
- Scraped 31 articles from El Tiempo News Outlet (2016-2023)
- Basic frequency analysis of key political terms
- Please note: This is exploratory work. 

**Tools used**
- _Collection:_ web scraping (BeautifulSoup, requests)
- _Visualization:_ matplotlib

**Analysis of El Tiempo coverage reveals:**
- _FARC_ appears in 71% of articles (22/31)
- _Paz_ appears in 22.6% of articles (7/31)
- _Guerrillero_ appears in only 6.5% of articles (2/31)
- _Excombatiente_ appears in only 3.2% of articles (1/31)

This suggests that peace process coverage remains strongly associated with the armed group (FARC) rather than emphasizing reintegration terminology (excombatiente). The low frequency of "guerrillero" may indicate shift away from explicit conflict terminology, though further analysis with larger corpus is needed.

**Temporal Patterns:**

FARC references decline from 83.3% (2016-2018) to 57.1% (2022-2023)
Reintegration terms ('excombatiente') remain minimal across all periods
'Paz' mentions show slight increase but limited overall presence

These preliminary patterns suggest evolving but still limited diversification of peace process framing in Colombian press discourse.

**Next Steps**
Please note: This analysis is limited by corpus size and lacks the formal pragmatic modeling (RSA framework) that would connect term frequency to epistemic inference.  
- Co-occurrence analysis to identify semantic entanglement patterns
- RSA modeling of epistemic priors derived from discourse patterns
- Formalization of discourse-cognition interface
