### Computational Analysis of Semantic Framing in Colombian Political Discourse

> **Note on Project Evolution**: This repository documents my learning journey in computational linguistics. The `z_archive/` folder contains my initial exploratory work (Phase 1: Exploratory work). Based on that learning, I refocused the project on a more specific research question about contested political terms.

### Project Evolution

### Phase 1: Exploratory Work (Archived)

**Goal**: Broad ambiguity analysis across Colombian legal decrees  
**Learned**: 
- Data collection (PDF extraction, OCR)
- spaCy basics for Spanish NLP
- Scope needed refinement for pre-MA work

### Phase 2: # Exploratory Analysis of Colombian Post-Peace Accord Discourse

**Description:** This pilot analysis explores semantic framing in Colombian post-accord media discourse as groundwork for my proposed MA research on pragmatic inference and epistemic models.

**Methodology:** 
- Scraped 30 articles from Semana News Outlet (2022-2023)
- Basic frequency analysis of key political terms
- Please note: This is exploratory work. 

**Tools used**
- Python (beautifulsoup, pandas, matplotlib)

**Limitations & Next Steps**
This analysis is limited by corpus size and lacks the formal pragmatic modeling (RSA framework) that would connect term frequency to epistemic inference.
